            <p>Obtain a Premium number to collect fees for text messages or calls without setting up a complicated payment scheme. Informatel has been delivering Premium Rate services for over 20 years,  and is one of Australia’s original service providers.</p>
            <img src="@Url.Content("/Content/images/index/icons-voice.png")" alt="" /><h4>Premium Rate Voice/SMS</h4>
            <p>Premium Rate number holders can invoice the caller’s phone bills, providing a simple way to collect payments without the need to set up credit/ payment schemes. Premium Rate numbers have a  190 prefix and are charged a fixed rate per call or per minute. Alternatively, a 19 prefix allows fixed rate SMS’s to be sent or received.</p>

            <img src="@Url.Content("/Content/images/index/icons-sms.png")" alt="" /><h4>Standard Rate SMS</h4>
            <p>Not all services have to be charged at a premium. Provide a free, value added service with a 1300 or 1800 prefix. SMS services can also be provided using normal mobile numbers with an 04 prefix.</p>
            <img src="@Url.Content("/Content/images/index/icons-credit-cards.png")" alt="" /><h4>Credit Cards</h4>
            <p>Our credit card processing systems process real time transactions for Visa, Master Card, Bankcard, American Express or Diners Card, and can be tailored to beginner or expert users. Incorporate credit card capabilities into any of your IVR, SMS, mobile or web based applications.</p>
            <img src="@Url.Content("/Content/images/index/icons-virtual-wallet.png")" alt="" /><h4>Virtual Wallet</h4>
